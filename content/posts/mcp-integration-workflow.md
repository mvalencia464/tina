# üôåüèºTesting MCP Integration: From Local Development to Production

Today we're testing our Model Context Protocol (MCP) integration with TinaCMS to ensure a smooth workflow from local development all the way to production deployment.

## The Workflow

Our testing process involves several key steps:

1. **Local Development**: Building and testing the TinaCMS preview application locally
2. **Content Management**: Creating and editing content through TinaCMS's rich-text editor
3. **Deployment**: Pushing changes to Netlify for production testing
4. **Integration Testing**: Verifying the MCP integration works end-to-end

## Demo Video

Here's a demonstration of the workflow in action:

## Key Features Being Tested

* **Rich-text Content Rendering**: Ensuring TinaCMS content displays properly using the `TinaMarkdown` component
* **Real-time Preview**: Testing the live preview functionality during content editing
* **Production Deployment**: Verifying the application works correctly in a production environment
* **Content Synchronization**: Ensuring content changes propagate correctly from TinaCMS to the deployed site

## Technical Implementation

The integration uses:

* **TinaCMS** for content management
* **React** with Vite for the frontend
* **TinaMarkdown** component for proper rich-text rendering
* **Netlify** for deployment and hosting
* **TinaCloud** for production content management

This post serves as a test case to verify that our MCP integration can successfully create, edit, and deploy content through the entire pipeline.

## Next Steps

If this post appears correctly on both the local development server and the production deployment, we'll know our MCP integration is working as expected!
