Local businesses face a unique challenge: they need professional, maintainable websites but often lack the technical resources of larger companies. TinaMCP (TinaCMS Model Context Protocol) offers an elegant solution that bridges this gap.

## The Local Business Content Challenge

Most local businesses struggle with content management because:

- **Technical Complexity**: Traditional CMSs require ongoing technical maintenance
- **Cost Constraints**: Enterprise solutions are too expensive for small operations
- **Time Limitations**: Business owners need to focus on operations, not wrestling with technology
- **Flexibility Needs**: Content requirements change as businesses evolve`
